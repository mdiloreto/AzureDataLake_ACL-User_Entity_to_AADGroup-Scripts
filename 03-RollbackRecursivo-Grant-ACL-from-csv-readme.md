This PowerShell script is designed to manage the Access Control Lists (ACLs) of a directory in Azure Data Lake Storage Gen2. It connects to your Azure account, retrieves the ACLs of a specified directory, removes specific ACL entries, then adds a new ACL entry from a CSV file. Finally, it updates the ACLs recursively for the specified directory and prints the final count of ACL entries.

$Tenant = ''                      # Azure Tenant ID
$Sub = ''                         # Azure Subscription ID
$SaName = ''                      # Storage Account Name
$ContainerName = ''                # Container Name
$DirName = ''                      # Directory Name, end with /
$ADSecGroupId = ''                 # Azure AD Security Group ID
$Pathcsv = ''                      # Path to CSV file containing ACL backup
$Permissions = 'rwx'               # Permissions in rwx notation
$PermissionsDetailed = 'Execute, Write, Read' # Permissions in detailed notation

1. Set your Azure Tenant ID, Subscription ID, Storage Account Name, Container Name, Directory Name, and the path to your ACL backup CSV file in the variables at the top of the script.

2. Run the script. It will do the following:
    - Connect to your Azure account.
    - Retrieve the current ACLs of the specified directory.
    - Remove all ACL entries with the specified permissions and which are of 'User' type.
    - Add ACL entries from the CSV file.
    - Update the ACLs recursively for the specified directory.
    - Print the final count of ACL entries.

The script will catch and print errors related to:
- Connecting to Azure or getting the filesystem.
- Getting the filesystem ACL.
- Removing an ACL entity.
- Removing ACL recursively.

Azure PowerShell module: Install it by running 'Install-Module -Name Az -Force -AllowClobber -Scope CurrentUser' in PowerShell.
